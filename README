This is a demo project created for a presentation at a SHRUG (Stockholm Ruby User Group) meeting.

Install MacRuby http://macruby.org and open in XCode to build the project. You also need the httparty gem installed:
$ macgem install httparty

The meat of the project is in main_window_controller.rb and in the xib.
